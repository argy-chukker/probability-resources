_**R. Durret "Probability Theory and Examples"**_
_(pdf from Duke U. [here](https://services.math.duke.edu/~rtd/PTE/PTE5_011119.pdf))_
An amazing introduction to probabilityh theory. For non-mathematicians, it comes with an initial chapter dealing with measure-theoretical prerequisites. A great primer that, nonetheless, dwelves into advanced topics.

_**E. Ã‡inlar "Probability and Stochastics"**_
_(springer page [here](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-87859-1))_
An introductory book focused on stochastic processes. Based on lecture notes, I found it very pedagogic. Despite it's first chapter about measure theory, I believe it is better read if with previous knowledge.

_**W. Feller "An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications"**_
_(google books page [here](https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Probability_Theory_an.html?hl=en&id=nLgdAQAAMAAJ))_
A classic; so somewhat outdated. Yet it may be its strenght: some reasonings do not rely on modern (technical) probability results but rather on real analysis ones. This leads to longer, maybe tedious, but more basic proofs.
